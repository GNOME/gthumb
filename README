  version 2 or greater, with the development tools installed properly.
  The following is the detailed list of libraries you need:

  If the libtiff library is present you can save images in TIFF
  format.

  If the libgphoto2 library version >= 2.1.3 is present you can import
  photos from your camera.

  If the libopenraw library version >= 0.0.2 is present you can view
  RAW photo thumbnails.

  If dcraw is present (and is in your executable search path), 
  gthumb can view full RAW photos.

  If exiv2 version 0.16 or higher is present, you can read XMP metadata.

  If pfstools and pfstmo are installed, gthumb can view HDR images. 
  See http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/pfstools.
  To view OpenEXR files with pfstools, the OpenEXR libraries need
  to be installed. See http://www.openexr.com/.
