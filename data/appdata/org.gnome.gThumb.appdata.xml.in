      gThumb is an image viewer, editor, browser and organizer.  It is designed
      to be well integrated with the GNOME 3 desktop.

      such as BMP, JPEG, GIF (including the animations), PNG, TIFF, TGA and
      RAW images.

      image such as EXIF, IPTC and XMP.

      As an image editor gThumb allows to scale, rotate and crop the images;
      change the saturation, lightness, contrast as well as other color
      transformations.

      your disk, allows to perform the common operations of a file manager such
      as copy, move and delete files and folders.

      lossless transformations; image resize; format conversion; slideshow;
      setting an image as desktop background and several others.
